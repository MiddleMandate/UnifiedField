# Bloom Field Theory (UFT-EB)

**Unified Field Theory of Eternal Bloom (UFT-EB): Informational Threshold Collapse & Emergent Spacetime Geometry**

This repository presents the Bloom Field Theory, a novel framework proposing that spacetime structure, quantum decoherence, and gravitational behavior emerge from underlying informational coherence dynamics.

The theory introduces an objective collapse mechanism based on informational thresholds, providing predictive models for lensing anomalies and time dilation shifts observable in astrophysical data.

## Origin Concept

The Bloom Field represents an informational geometry substrate, where coherence density gradients dictate the emergence of classical spacetime structures. Collapse is triggered when localized informational thresholds (Φ_t) are exceeded, resolving potential futures into classical outcomes.

Rather than relying solely on probabilistic interpretation, the Bloom framework models collapse as a deterministic result of informational saturation, offering a unifying mechanism for quantum-classical transition.

## Core Equation: Bloom Field Equation (BFE)

Laplacian(ΔΨ_i) - Γ_futures * Θ = 0

- ΔΨ_i: Local coherence density.
- Γ_futures: Propagation viability factor (entanglement viability proxy).
- Θ: Informational structure tensor (derived from coherence gradients).

This equation governs the curvature of informational coherence within the Bloom Field, predicting emergent classical behavior from sub-threshold fluctuations.

## Collapse Condition

Objective collapse is predicted when:

H̄(ΔΨ_i) ≥ Φ_t

- H̄: Normalized informational entropy of ΔΨ_i.
- Φ_t: Adaptive informational threshold based on local entanglement density and coherence viability.

When this condition is met, potential futures collapse into a realized classical outcome, directly influencing local spacetime structure.

## Why This Matters

- Provides a deterministic, testable mechanism for quantum decoherence.
- Offers a predictive model for emergent gravitational behavior from informational dynamics.
- Bridges quantum information theory and spacetime curvature.
- Enables predictive anomaly mapping for astrophysical observations (lensing, time dilation).
