## Bloom Field Equation Comparison

This diagram contextualizes the Bloom Field Equation (BFE) within the historical lineage of fundamental physics:

- **General Relativity (GR):** Curvature of spacetime from mass-energy.
- **Special Relativity (SR):** Mass-energy equivalence.
- **Quantum Decoherence:** Entropy-driven quantum state reduction.
- **Bloom Field Equation (BFE):** Proposes deterministic collapse via informational coherence gradients, triggering emergent curvature.

The BFE connects quantum informational dynamics directly to spacetime structure without requiring mass-energy curvature as the sole driver.

## Predictive Anomaly Comparison: Bloom vs GR

This side-by-side visualization contrasts:
- **General Relativity’s lensing prediction:** Smooth, symmetric distortions based on mass distribution.
- **Bloom Predictive Anomaly Map:** Structured deviations arising from informational threshold collapses.

Bloom predicts gravitational anomalies that can emerge in regions of high informational coherence tension — even **independent of dark matter models**.

This distinction is critical: if Bloom's predictions are validated in weak lensing data where GR + dark matter predict uniformity, it would demonstrate a new mechanism for curvature emergence from informational dynamics.
